## Desciption
This code was created to demosntrate how to add a popup to a webpage. A "close" div was added to it so users can close it to use the website.

## Language
This project was developed using React.

## Command Lines
This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app.

To visualize the content, run the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.js. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

API routes can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/api/hello. This endpoint can be edited in pages/api/hello.js.

The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/*. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
